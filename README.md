## Key Features

### GPT API Integration
While currently only the Gemini API integration is available, The website will later on utilize multiple GPT-based APIs (such as ChatGPT, Claude) and to fetch real-time data and perform operations, ensuring that users have access to reliable and comparable AI-driven information and services.

### Technologies Used
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building UI and Front-end.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **GPT-based APIs**: Used for fetching and interacting with real-time data and services provided by various GPT models.
